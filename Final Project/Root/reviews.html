                    Great and entertaining comic statues.
                    If you're a comic fan you'll love this place.
                    The only issue is that if you want to take a pic of a statue, you will be pretty close to others enjoying their meals.
                    It is a pretty neat spot though. Definitely a unique spot.

                    The kids and husband loved it. I would suggest at least  trying it once if you are into comics or the kids are.
                    They let you look around the entire restaurant to see the different figurines, which you can take pictures with.

                                Super cool spot for anyone! You don't have to be just into comics to enjoy this everything pop culture themed restaurant.
                                All of the decorations and designs make you feel like you were transformed into comic universe!
